# Min-Set-Cover

### Description
Min-Set-Cover problem is used to find the least number of sets that can cover the union of all given sets.
I implemented a sub-optimal Greedy Algorithm for this problem in MIPS assembly.
     
### Usage
This project takes sets from input.txt.(You can change document another test)
Input format must be row order.

### RoadMap
This project has a small limitation. Element of set cant not two or more digit. So element of set must be between 0-9. I want to improve this situation.If you want contribute to me for this situation , please contact me.
